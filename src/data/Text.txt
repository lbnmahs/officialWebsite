ABOUT PAGE
----------
I am a front end developer based in Kenya. I love creating beautiful, minimalistic and top-tier websites with an awesome user experience. I am interested in the frontend world because I like experessing myself with it via building great projects. I love drawing, listening to music and watching movies, series and anime. I am a fun guy if you get to know me well.
